///JSON FILE
Under model I have a JSON file that has data that will be loaded into the mongoose
each object can be edited, updated and deleted, also you can add more throught the application -
by creating an account. 

//API
Also due issues with finding a api with images, I used hygraph to create my own car images api. 
I created api car rental api, that has car cost per day for renting, KM Per Liter, how many seat, what kind of transmission, car brand name, etc

///DATA STORED IN MONGO
//COLLECTIONS
1.user
2.rental

//Features
You can select and make resveration for a car, it would be stored in mongoose
in the Cars Catalog next to min-max you can sort cars by specfic name and also get max - min values

you can add users in admin, delete, update also. 
All the user in the admin page are able to login
also a functional nav bar.
 
Pressing any of the cars, gives you a rental form, that is stored in mongo, and after filling the form and press rent, it stores 
it and takes you to a payment page. 

I have a json file, which is used to store all the 20 plus user into mongo. 
The file is call jsonData
